TROFF TOOLS
===========

This is the port of Plan9 troff tools to Linux which probably works
in other Unix variants with minor modifications.  The included
programs are troff, tr2ps (dpost), eqn, tbl, pic, and grap.

SETTING UP
==========

Change TBASE variable conf.mk to point the home folder in this
package.  Then compile everything:

  $ for t in troff tr2ps eqn tbl pic grap; do cd $t; make; cd ..; done

Next, you may want to copy the binaries to a directory in your $PATH.

Note that the included troff font description files are smaller than
the ones included in Plan9 and are generated using mkdev tool
(included in this package).  But you can use the ones from Plan9
too.

DPOST CHANGES
=============

tr2ps no longer reads TBASE/ps/troff/* files to find the mapping
between troff fonts and PS fonts.  Each troff font is mapped to
exactly one PS font which is declared as fontname in font
description files.  So tr2ps reads only troff description files.
UTF8 entries in troff font files work as before but the fifth column
now denotes a glyph's postscript name if available.  For glyphs not
in the 256-entry PS font encoding table, tr2ps uses these glyph
names to draw these characters in the generated postscript file.
This would make adding new fonts to troff much easier.

TODO
====

* Remove the use of lex and yacc in eqn and pic.  I hate lex and yacc
  as much as I like a well written recursive decent parser.
* Some of the tools could be cleaned up considerably
